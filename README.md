Used [NTH-start-project](https://github.com/nicothin/NTH-start-project) for a starter kit. The project is in Russian. Therefore, all the Cyrillic in the commentary or readme — from there.

Use [link](https://dennislypovetsky.github.io/voverc/) in the description to checkout the work or go to [src/blocks](https://github.com/DennisLypovetsky/voverc/tree/master/src/blocks) to see the code.

I cleaned up a bit to make it more convinient and delete unused folders from the starter kit.
